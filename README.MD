# ğŸ§  Question 1:
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]  
Because nums[0] + nums[1] === 9

# ğŸ§  Question 2:
Write a function that checks if a string is a valid palindrome. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and case.
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"  
Output: true

Input: "race a car"  
Output: false

# ğŸ§  Question 3:
Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character in a string. If thereâ€™s no non-repeating character, return null.
Input: "leetcode"  
Output: "l"

Input: "aabbcc"  
Output: null

# ğŸ§  Question 4:
Write a function that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Input: "abcabcbb"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# ğŸ§  Question 5:
Given an array of integers nums, find the maximum product of any three numbers.
Input: [1, 2, 3]  
Output: 6

Input: [-10, -10, 5, 2]  
Output: 500

# ğŸ§  Question 6:
Given a list of daily temperatures, return a new list such that, for each day in the input, it tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

Input: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]  
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# ğŸ§  Question 7:
You are given an integer array nums. You are also given an integer k.

Your task is to return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that:

nums[i] === nums[j], and

the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Otherwise, return false.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1], k = 3  
Output: true

Input: nums = [1, 0, 1, 1], k = 1  
Output: true

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], k = 2  
Output: false

# ğŸ§  Question 8:
Given an array of integers nums, return all unique triplets in the array which sum up to zero.

Input: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]  
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]


# ğŸ§  Question 10:
You are given an array heights representing the height of walls. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water it can store.

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]  
Output: 49


# ğŸ§  Question 11:
Given an integer array nums, return the number of good pairs.
A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]  
Output: 4

# ğŸ§  Question 12 (New):
You are given an array of integers nums. Return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers (regardless of order).

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  
Output: 4  
// The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4] 

# DSA:

# ğŸ§  Question 13 (New):
insert a element in an array without using inbuilt method
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [100, 4, 5, 200, 1, 3, 2]


# ğŸ§  Question 14  (New):
delete an element in an array without using inbuilt method
Input: [100, 4, 5, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

# ğŸ§  Question 15  (New):
merge two array without using inbuilt method

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# ğŸ§  Question 16  (New):
reverse a array without creating a  new  array

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
