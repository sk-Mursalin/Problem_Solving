# ğŸ§  Question 1:
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]  
Because nums[0] + nums[1] === 9

# ğŸ§  Question 2:
Write a function that checks if a string is a valid palindrome. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and case.
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"  
Output: true

Input: "race a car"  
Output: false

# ğŸ§  Question 3:
Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character in a string. If thereâ€™s no non-repeating character, return null.
Input: "leetcode"  
Output: "l"

Input: "aabbcc"  
Output: null

# ğŸ§  Question 4:
Write a function that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Input: "abcabcbb"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# ğŸ§  Question 5:
Given an array of integers nums, find the maximum product of any three numbers.
Input: [1, 2, 3]  
Output: 6

Input: [-10, -10, 5, 2]  
Output: 500

# ğŸ§  Question 6:
Given a list of daily temperatures, return a new list such that, for each day in the input, it tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

Input: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]  
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# ğŸ§  Question 7:
You are given an integer array nums. You are also given an integer k.

Your task is to return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that:

nums[i] === nums[j], and

the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Otherwise, return false.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1], k = 3  
Output: true

Input: nums = [1, 0, 1, 1], k = 1  
Output: true

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], k = 2  
Output: false
